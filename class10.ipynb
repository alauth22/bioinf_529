    "Calculating the relative expression of RNA involves mapping RNA sequence reads to a reference and then counting the relative abundance of each transcript. Tools doing this typically build a reference assembly out of known transcripts to speed processing and avoid complications of reads crossing splice junctions. However, it is also the case that reads can be mapped to a genome assembly directly to identify novel transcripts or when there are no concerns with intervening intronic sequence. In our class today, we will be implementing RNA-seq analysis for our sample genome that has no introns, and so we will use the reference assembly that was generated in the previous class.\n"
