    "Today we will start implementing a frequently used hierarchical clustering algorithm from Sokal and Michener (1958) called UPGMA - unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages. The first step of this algorithm requires that we build a distance matrix for all of the alignments that we will be clustering. To accomplish this today, we will be using the Hamming distance of the sequences. The Hamming distance is total edit distance between two strings (the total number of changes required to make two strings exactly match). This metric requires that the strings are the same length. Luckily, our previous work on alignments results in strings that are all the same length and optimally aligned! We will be using those strings as input.\n"
