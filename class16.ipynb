The chain of match (M), insert (I), and deletion (D) states can be extended to match the length of the multiple sequence alignment that is used as the training set to produce a model. Individual sequences may then be aligned to the model and scored based on the probability that the model would emit that sequence."

    "We will be implementing a Profile HMM using the BAR domain discussed in the slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we will implement two functions. First, `get_valid_states()` will provide a list of states that meet our heuristic threshold in the model (denoted as *s in the slides). Second, we will implement `build_profileHMM()` that will use our existing HMM class structure (inlcuded here in HMM.py) to develop a model in the above structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few caveats: Our HMM implementation requires that all possible emissions and transitions exist in the dictionary. That is, any hidden state must have probabilities of emiting the entire alphabet and the transition matrix must have a probability for every state going to every other state in the model. These probabilites can be set to 0 to create the profile HMM structure, but they must be set."
